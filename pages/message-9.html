        Number 9: Fortune, service, selflessness, and completion
      </h1>
      <p class="message-explanation">
        Natives with Kabbalah number 9 are commitment-loving people. They live
        their life with some purpose and focus on big goals. Moreover, these
        natives believe in completion. However, they never lack in making
        sacrifices for others. They love to spend time helping others, but on
        the other hand, they also have an ego. Therefore, these people take no
        time in making detachments. They also focus on happiness, and generosity
        is their second name.
